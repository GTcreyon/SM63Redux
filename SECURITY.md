## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a serious vulnerability that could be exploited by a bad actor to cause harm, please do not submit an issue, as this would expose the issue to be taken advantage of. Instead, report the issue directly to a member of the team, either through Discord (https://discord.gg/ctkyscUSBA), or via the email sm63redux@gmail.com.
