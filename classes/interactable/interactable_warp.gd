class_name InteractableWarp
extends Interactable
# A variant of Interactable that warps the player somewhere,
# either to another scene or someplace in the current one.
# 
# To implement this base class, there are two functions to extend:
# - _animation_length() returns the expected duration of the animation
#   as an int.
# - _update_animation(_frame, _player) updates the enter animation for the
#   given frame.
# For further customization, you can override _interact_check() if you want
# it to respond to a different button than "up",
# or override _begin_scene_change(target_pos, scene_pos) to change what
# transition will be used on scene change (star iris out by default).
# Additionally, override _exit_pos_offset() to shift all destination positions
# across the game by some amount. The value returned will be added to the 
# destination.
# 
# Please note that if the particular warp is set to move to a different scene,
# the exit transition will begin TRANSITION_SPEED_IN frames before the end of
# the animation.
#
# For convenience, an animation function is included to shift the player slowly
# to a position. This is meant to be run once per frame, probably in the
# entry animation, and should be useful for centering the player to the right
# spot.

	# jump (and become unable to use warps) BEFORE the warp has a chance to
	# make the player enter, and by the time it tries the player is no longer
	# grounded. In other words, warps only work if they're placed ABOVE the
