# This function is part of an ugly hack to make quick-pipe work.
# With quick-pipe, the pipe activates if the player is grounded AND either
# a button is pressed OR the player is pounding.
# Unfortunately, the base Interactable class runs its activation code if
# button is pressed AND player is grounded...and there's no way to check
# the player state in the button-press half of the code.
# So rather than add a player variable to the button press check (that's this
# function), which would make life hard for other Interactables for no reason,
# we instead rely on the AND structure of the base interactable check:
# return unconditionally true from this function, then do all the logic we
# actually care about in the other side, including the button check.
# Ugly? Yes. Future-proof? Absolutely not.
# Works? Currently, yes :)
