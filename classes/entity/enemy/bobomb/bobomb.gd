class_name Bobomb
extends EntityEnemyWalk
# Bobombs wander until a player enters their alert area.
# This will begin their fuse, and they will pursue the player at a higher speed.
# They will explode, dropping a coin once their fuse runs out.
# When their fuse is lit, they do not lose focus on the player.
# They can be struck to send them flying a short distance before exploding.

# When two bombs play the buildup sound at once, the sound gets confusing.
# Would be nice to have it choose from two or three different pitches so
# the player can differentiate which sound belongs to which bomb, but
# picking at random is likely to give two bombs the same pitch more often than
# not, and making a global "in-use bomb sound" pool would require modifying
# the singleton--which sounds like a pretty far-reaching change for a little
# problem like this!
# So for now, multiple buildup sounds is off the table.
