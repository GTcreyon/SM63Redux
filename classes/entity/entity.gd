# Entities may or may not have certain functionality nodes.
# The WaterCheck node, for example, is used to determine if the entity is in water or not.
# However, this may not always be necessary. If an entity is unaffected by water, this node is obsolete.
# As such, we want an implementation in which nodes are optional, and the code handles this.
# For that, we use a private exported node path, that can be assigned in the scene editor.
# This is then loaded into the main variable on ready.
# If this returns null, we assume the node does not exist, and as such functionality is disabled.

# Virtual methods such as _ready(), _process() and _physics_process() behave unusually when inherited.

# As such, overriding them doesn't actually disable the original functionality.
# For this reason, we wrap the code in a separate function, which can be overridden properly.
